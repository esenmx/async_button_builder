# [3.0.0+1] - 2022-02-13

- Fix `Undefined name 'optionalTypeArgs'.` Also adds back the hard dep on freezed_annotation.

## [3.0.0] - 2022-02-13

- Added notification functionality. The error variant now passes through the error and stacktrace which would be needed for a notification to be useful. This is a breaking change as the error widget now takes an error and stacktrace as arguments.

- Not pushed

## [2.3.0+2] - 2022-05-24

Fix possibility of nested async button builders conflicting with each other due to matching keyed subtrees. In order to avoid this situation, the parent key of the async_button_builder is used in the creation of sub widgets.

Was not using proper sucessDuration when setting timeouts (regression)

## [2.0.8-nullsafety.0] - 2021-02-12

Trying to bump version again to go over stable

## [2.0.7-nullsafety.8] - 2021-02-12

Republish so current nullsafe becomes main. My mistake

## [2.0.2-nullsafety.7] - 2021-02-12

Added a typedef in place of inline type on function. Added doc to `builder` field

## [2.0.2-nullsafety.6] - 2021-02-09

Renamed Union classes to match that of factory constructor name (Should not be breaking).

## [2.0.2-nullsafety.5] - 2021-02-01

Removed example integration test

## [2.0.2-nullsafety.4] - 2021-01-26

Removes dangling controller and cleans up main code up a bit

## [2.0.2-nullsafety.2] - 2021-01-25

Fixes wrong image path

## [2.0.1-nullsafety.2] - 2021-01-25

Renames fields to better match standards of other buttons.

## [2.0.0-dev.1] - 2021-01-25

Breaking. Replaces the fourth argument with a sealed union that better allows for directly managing states, removes unnecessary arguments such as padding, adds transition builders for custom transitions. Currently still includes `AnimatedSize`.

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.0] - 2021-01-12

Breaking. Adds a fourth argument of loading to the builder. This removes the value notifier that was difficult or confusing to manage in actual usage in my use cases. The argument isLoading is now a `bool`. This also adds a `disabled` field in order to set that on construction.

## [0.1.0-nullsafety.0] - 2021-01-12

Replaces the bool type of isLoading for a `ValueNotifier<bool>`.

## [0.0.1-nullsafety.2] - 2021-01-12

Adds analysis options and removes unnecessary typedef

## [0.0.1-nullsafety.1] - 2021-01-12

Adds docs to parameters and removes use of unnecessary undescore internal variables.

## [0.0.1-nullsafety.0] - 2021-01-11

Holds basic builder AsyncButtonBuilder. No tests yet. `NNBD` is supported
